How would you pitch your game in one line? It's like good pizza great pizza but you make potions and spells instead

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? experiment with ingredients to make the best potions! as you progress through the game, you level up and get more ingredients depending on how fast you progress. get it wrong- and the potion might just explode-bubble-burst!

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) the player will get a general ingredient list and what combinations give what features to the potion. while this guide will remain accessible at all times, as the player starts progressing and more ingredients are added/challenges get harder, this guide becomes harder to reference to for eg once you get a certain ingredient eg frog legs you only get to see the guide every two potions, then three etc. the end result is you get all the ingredients, and earn the most money by making the potions the fastest and best.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? game will get harder as you go, requests for potions get more difficult with more time restraints etc.
