# Neko Knight

**Team Members:** Justin, Guangxiu, Wes

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a metroidvania like Hollow Knight, but you are limited to two throwable and multi-functional knives to use as weapons.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- The knives can be used in many ways. They can be used for melee combat, throwing, grappling onto surfaces, stepping onto, and pushing buttons.
- Because you only have two knives, you must be wise in how you use them. For example, if both knives are currently pressing buttons, then you won't be able to defend yourself. If one knife is being used as a grappling hook, then you can only use the other knife for combat and your attacks are 0.5x slower.
- Movement is fast-paced with frequent dashing, jumping, and navigating through difficult obstacles.
- New abilities for the knives are unlocked as you progress.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. Explore new areas in the game map and discover new abilities for your knives.
2. Fight unique enemies that are defeated in different ways. 
3. You begin the game as a character with no memories, so uncover the story of the game as you progress.
4. It's easy to die in this game, but checkpoints are available throughout the map allowing players to learn from their mistakes.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- The game map is vast and full of discoveries that reveal the story, encouraging the player to explore as and progress.
- The controls are intuitive and easy to learn, but practice is needed to master them. Players will be motivated to improve their skills to overcome the difficult obstacles and enemies in the way.
- New abilities obtained will open more opportunities in the game, and players will be impressed with how far they progressed.
- Colorful and engaging artstyle will keep players engaged.
