# Pizza Panic

**Team Members:** Rishabh

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
We have to do a parkour and collect pizza ingredients, and use the ingredients to make pizza.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
As the person goes higher up the levels. The level starts becoming more complicated, and there are fun twists like tunnels. Not only that but making pizza looks fun.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
So basically they do a starter level to get introduced to the controls. They collect the ingredients and then go into a house. In the house, they cook the pizza. After cooking the pizza another level gets opened. We do the same thing make a new level with more fun stuff and so on. I am thinking of making 20 levels. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The higher the level the more harder it is. Hence they will be engaged to keep trying and trying until they finish it.
